A desktop app serves its channels to AI agents. `serveDesktopAgent(channels, options)` in `gesso-electrobun/desktop` serves them over MCP from the main process with `Bun.serve`, which Cottontail provides, on `127.0.0.1:7310` or the next free port after it, refusing any request a web page sends, and reports the URL to connect. `messageBoxConfirm(Utils.showMessageBox)` puts a `@confirm` command to the person with the native dialog, Decline by default. The screen tools are not offered there, since the screen is in each window's render worker.

Electrobun bundles the main process with its own build, which takes no plugins, so `gesso-vite-plugin` now ships `gesso-channels`, a command that reads contracts with the same TypeScript 7 checker and writes a module describing them, for the main process to import once; `--check` fails when it is out of date.

The Electrobun template uses all of it: the counter is served to agents as the app starts, `hutch run channels` writes `src/shared/channels.described.ts` before every build, `hutch run typecheck` checks it is current, and the contract's JSDoc is written for an agent to read. The template moves to TypeScript 7, clearing the projected config's `baseUrl`, which TypeScript 7 removed, and to Vite 8, with `vite.config.ts` using `import.meta.dirname` and an explicit `.ts` import as Vite 8's config loader asks.
