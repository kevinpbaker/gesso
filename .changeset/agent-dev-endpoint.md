An AI agent can drive a web application while it runs in development. `gesso-vite-plugin` serves MCP at `/__gesso/mcp` on the dev server and prints the `claude mcp add` line to connect; the agent then sees every channel the open page can reach, the ones its render worker feeds and the ones its application and channel workers serve, and its commands change the page as a click would. Messages travel down the HMR socket to the page, which answers them against the render worker, which asks each worker behind it over a `gesso:agent` port. A command marked `@confirm` is put to the person with the browser's dialog first. The endpoint refuses requests from browser pages, the newest open tab answers, and `agent: false` turns it off. A build carries none of it.

`gesso-framework/agent` gains what the bridge is made of: `serveAgentPort`, `remoteSurface` and `combineSurfaces` for a surface across threads, `connectDevAgent` for the page's half, and `AgentSurfaceLike` for a surface whose answers are promises, which `handleMcpMessage` and `mcpHandler` now accept. `WorkerApp.openRenderPort(key)` opens a port to the render worker. The scaffolded `AGENTS.md` says how to connect.
